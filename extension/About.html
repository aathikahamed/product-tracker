            <p >There are times when we can not afford something, or we do not want to spend much money on a particular product.
               Checking price updates manually for sales can be tiring, so you can use this extension to do the work for you.
                It will check for price updates continuously, and when there is a reduction, it will notify you instantly.

          <p>As a product's price varies across stores, we often manually look for a better price, but with this extension, 
            you can find the lowest price available over the internet within seconds.

        <p>The lowest price might not be the best deal because of the product's quality,
           so product rating can be very important. This extension can find the best-rated product available over the internet.

        <p>Often you cannot buy affordable items because they ran out of stock, but you do not have to worry when you have this extension.
           This extension will continuously look for the availability of the item you
            are looking for and will notify you as soon as stocks are available.
